1,Projects slip by 2 months across Europe. What happens to utilization and revenue next quarter?,"Expect a utilization dip during the slip (more bench). Revenue drops roughly in proportion to billable days lost: ΔRevenue ≈ MD_rate × delivery_FTE × workdays × ΔUtilization. If no backfill, margin also falls because fixed overhead stays. Mitigation: redeploy to other programs, pull-forward pipeline, use subcontractors selectively."
2,"If we raise average utilization from 72% to 78% over 6 months, what’s the revenue upside?","Revenue scales ~linearly with utilization. Upside ≈ (78%-72%)/72% ≈ +8.3% on delivery revenue once fully achieved (ramped over 6 months). Fixed costs unchanged, so profit/margin typically improves more than revenue."
3,Rate pressure: blended day rate down 4% from next month. What’s the 12‑month impact?,"Delivery revenue declines ~4% immediately (after ramp). If costs unchanged, profit drops by about 4% of delivery revenue. To offset: increase utilization, adjust staffing mix (more near/offshore), or renegotiate scope/fees."
4,We must keep profit flat despite 3% wage inflation. What levers do we have?,"Profit flat requires compensating uplift: higher utilization, higher rates, or lower capacity cost. If wage costs rise 3% on the variable layer, you need ~3% revenue uplift (rate/utilization) or equivalent cost savings; fixed overhead reductions help but usually lag."
5,Client asks: ‘No layoffs’. How do we cut total cost by 5% in 12 months?,"Use attrition + hiring slowdown, reduce subcontractor spend, and cut discretionary overhead. With fixed costs, a 5% total reduction implies a larger reduction in the variable portion; stage it: immediate contractor reductions, then hiring freeze, then redeploy to keep utilization high."
6,What happens if bench time increases by 10 days per consultant per year?,That reduces billable capacity. Effective utilization falls by ~10/250 ≈ 4%. Revenue drops ~4% unless offset. Fixed costs unchanged → margin deterioration.
7,We add 500 FTE in India (lower-cost) over 18 months. What’s the expected margin effect?,"Costs per FTE drop and blended delivery cost improves, but revenue depends on sell-through (utilization). If demand exists, margin improves; if demand lags, bench rises and the benefit is muted—ramp hiring to pipeline."
8,A key account is lost (10% of revenue) starting Q3. How should capacity change?,"Reduce capacity over a ramp to match demand: cut subcontractors first, redeploy to other accounts, pause hiring, then selective reductions. Goal: protect utilization; otherwise profit falls more than revenue due to fixed overhead."
9,Utilization is capped at 80% due to compliance/training. What is the maximum revenue we can plan for?,"Max revenue ≈ MD_rate × delivery_FTE × workdays × 80%. Planning beyond that implies overtime, subcontractors, or unmet delivery."
10,Move 200 FTE from US to CZ over 24 months. What happens to costs and rates?,"Delivery cost per FTE declines, improving gross margin if revenue holds. Rates may not change if pricing is market-based; manage quality/coverage. Expect a ramped cost reduction (not instant) and transition costs in year 1."
11,What’s the impact of a 4‑day workweek in one region if output must stay constant?,Capacity per FTE drops ~20% there; to keep output constant you need ~25% more FTE in that region (1/0.8−1). Costs rise unless offset by productivity gains or rate increases.
12,Attrition rises from 12% to 18% for 2 years. What happens to delivery capacity?,"Net capacity shrinks unless hiring increases. Expect utilization volatility: short-term may rise (fewer people), then falls due to backfill/training. Revenue risk from unfilled roles and slower delivery; mitigate with faster recruiting and subcontractors."
13,Increase utilization targets from 75% to 82%. How many FTE can we avoid hiring to meet the same demand?,Required FTE is inversely proportional to utilization. Avoided FTE ≈ 1 − (75/82) ≈ 8.5% of the delivery headcount needed for the same billable demand.
14,Cost of project delay by 6 weeks on a 300‑person program?,"If work pauses, lost billables ≈ MD_rate × 300 × ~30 workdays. If work continues but milestones slip, cashflow/revenue recognition may delay depending on contract terms."
15,We want +2pp margin improvement by year-end. What are realistic moves?,"Combine levers: +3–4pp utilization on target groups, +1–2% blended rate via repricing, reduce subcontractor mix, and trim overhead. Effects typically ramp over 3–6 months."
16,How does a 5% increase in average salary to improve retention affect costs and required revenue?,"Variable cost per FTE rises ~5%. To keep profit, you need ~5% uplift in delivery revenue on that base (via rate or utilization) or offsetting cost reductions elsewhere; fixed overhead unchanged."
17,"If sick leave rises by 1.5 days per FTE per year, what is capacity loss and needed headcount?","Capacity loss ≈ 1.5/250 ≈ 0.6% of capacity. To maintain output, add ~0.6% capacity (hire ~0.6% more FTE or raise utilization/productivity equivalently)."
18,Cap total labor cost growth at 2% YoY while wage inflation is 4%. What headcount can we support?,"With wage inflation 4%, holding labor cost to 2% implies headcount must shrink roughly 2% YoY (since cost ≈ wage × headcount), ignoring mix changes."
19,What FTE reduction offsets 6% wage inflation while keeping total labor cost flat?,"Flat labor cost implies headcount falls about 6% (cost ≈ wage × headcount). If you treat a small portion as fixed overhead, the required headcount reduction is slightly less for total cost, but ~6% is a good first estimate."
20,Automation reduces workload 15% by 2029. What FTE path is feasible?,"If demand constant, required delivery capacity falls ~15% by 2029. Use attrition/hiring slowdown: roughly 3–4% fewer FTE per year over 4–5 years (compounded), aligned to benefit realization."
21,Subcontractors are 12% of delivery. What if we cut them to 5%?,"Short-term capacity gap unless you hire/redeploy. Financially, subcontractors often cost more per day, so margin improves if replaced with employees at similar utilization; plan a 3–6 month transition."
22,Utilization drops 5pp for 9 months due to pipeline weakness. What should we do?,"Revenue falls roughly in proportion to the utilization drop. Actions: slow hiring, reduce subcontractors first, redeploy to internal initiatives, intensify sales, and consider temporary time-off programs to manage costs without layoffs."
23,A new regulation adds 2% non-billable compliance time permanently. What’s the long-run effect?,Effective utilization ceiling reduces by ~2pp. Long-run revenue ~2% lower unless rates rise or capacity increases. You may need ~2% more FTE to deliver the same billable volume.
24,"Increase nearshore mix, reducing blended delivery cost by 3% over 2 years. How does that show up?","Gradual gross margin improvement (cost down ~3%) with a ramp. Revenue unchanged unless pricing changes. Include transition costs early; after ramp, slope returns to baseline."
25,Keep revenue flat but cut idle capacity losses by half. What must improve?,"Idle loss is driven by bench (1−utilization). Halving idle loss means halving bench proportion. Example: if utilization 75% (bench 25%), target bench 12.5% → utilization 87.5%. Often needs a mix of utilization improvement, better staffing, and pipeline smoothing."
